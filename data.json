    {"q":"What are the key limitations and biases of the α-algorithm?","a":"Cannot handle short loops (length 1 or 2), invisible transitions, duplicate labels; sensitive to noise and incomplete logs."},
    {"q":"Describe the Heuristic Miner’s basic approach to discovery.","a":"Compute frequency-based dependency measures between activities, apply thresholds to filter edges, and build a causal graph from surviving dependencies."},
    {"q":"What guarantees does the Inductive Miner provide, and what are its drawbacks?","a":"Guarantees a sound, block-structured model and handles noise; may overfit, over-split rare variants, and struggle with highly unstructured logs."},
    {"q":"Outline the state-based regions algorithm.","a":"Construct a transition system from the log, identify consistent state regions, map them to places, and assemble a Petri net capturing observed behavior."},
    {"q":"Briefly explain the language-based regions algorithm.","a":"Derive the trace language from the log, find pairs of activities that never co-occur, create places enforcing these separations, and build the net."},
    {"q":"How is evolutionary computing applied to process-model discovery?","a":"Encode candidate models as genomes, evaluate fitness against the log (e.g., fitness/precision), and apply genetic operators to evolve better models."},
    {"q":"What is token-based replay in conformance checking?","a":"Simulate token flow on a WF-net for each trace, record missing and leftover tokens, and compute fitness based on produced vs. consumed tokens."},
    {"q":"Define alignments in conformance checking and why they are useful.","a":"Optimal correspondence between model moves and log events minimizing cost of insertions/deletions; handle invisible transitions and provide precise deviation metrics."}
