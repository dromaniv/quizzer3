    {"q":"Will pure genetic drift (no variation) eventually remove diversity?","a":"Yes; one allele will reach 100 % and the population becomes uniform."},
    {"q":"Which operator does GOMEA rely on exclusively?","a":"Gene-pool Optimal Mixing (GOM)."},
    {"q":"What is the essence of lexicase selection?","a":"Filter individuals through test cases in random order, keeping only tie-winners each step."},
